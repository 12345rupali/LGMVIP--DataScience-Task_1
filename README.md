# Iris Flower Classification

This repository contains a machine learning project that focuses on the classification of Iris flowers. The project utilizes the famous Iris dataset, which consists of measurements of sepals and petals from three different species of Iris flowers.

The goal of this project is to build a model that can accurately classify Iris flowers based on their sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The classification task involves predicting the species of the Iris flower, which can be one of three classes: setosa, versicolor, or virginica.

# Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the Iris dataset, which was introduced by the statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher in 1936. It is a multivariate dataset that includes measurements of 150 Iris flowers from three different species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica. Each sample has four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

The dataset is commonly used for classification tasks and is available in various machine learning libraries and repositories.

# Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

1. Import all the dependencies which are required .
2. 'data/' : This directory contains the Iris dataset in CSV format. 
3. We analysis dataset. 
4. We Visualized dataset by plotting graphs from famous library called Seaborn and matplotlib.
5. The dataset is split into two files: 'df_train.csv' for training the model and 'df_test.csv' for evaluating the model's performance.
6. Perform some classification algorithm on dataset such as:
    a)Logistic Regression

    b)K-N-Neighbours

    c)Navie Bayes

    d)Decision Tree

    e)Support Vector Mechanism

7. And See the Accuracy of each of them and plot gragh.

# Results

The trained model achieved an accuracy of 93% on the test set, demonstrating its ability to classify Iris flowers accurately. Checking and evaluating the accuracy by using metrices.

# Conclusion

This project showcases the application of machine learning techniques for classifying Iris flowers based on their measurements. By following the instructions provided, you can reproduce the model, evaluate its performance, and use it to make predictions on new data.

Feel free to explore the code and modify it as per your requirements. Enjoy classifying Iris flowers with machine learning!
